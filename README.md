A hands-on SOC Automation Lab built using Wazuh, TheHive, Cortex, and ELK. Demonstrates real-time threat detection, alert forwarding, and automated incident response in a simulated enterprise environment.
1. Introduction
 1.1Overview
The SOC Automation Project aims to create an automated Security Operations Center (SOC) workflow that streamlines event monitoring, alerting, and incident response. By leveraging powerful open-source tools such as Wazuh, Shuffle, and TheHive, this project enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of SOC operations. The project involves setting up a Windows 10 client with Sysmon for detailed event generation, Wazuh for comprehensive event management and alerting, Shuffle for workflow automation, and TheHive for case management and coordinated response actions.
